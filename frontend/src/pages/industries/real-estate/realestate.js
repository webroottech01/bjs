                  <p>
                    The Real Estate sector requires a lot of movement of people
                    and goods. Sales agents, truck drivers, and more. It is hard
                    to keep track of everyone. Our field agent management
                    services deploy advanced software solutions and proper
                    supervision by our experts to avoid any unnecessary delays
                    in any process.

                  <p>
                    Real Estate is a hugely labour-intensive sector. Due to the
                    overwhelming number of people involved in real estate
                    projects, it is quite hard to track and look after the
                    workforce accurately. Fortunately, BJS offers human resource
                    services that track and ensure all employees are putting
                    their best foot forward. While doing so, they also make sure
                    the well-being of all employees is accounted for. Proper
                    employee benefits, insurance, leaves, and compensations are
                    formulated to keep employees happy without breaking the
                    bank.

                    Unlike conventional sales teams, our modern combined
                    marketing and sales teams, collectively known as integrated
                    sales teams, stay connected with customers right from 1st
                    interaction until sale completion. This ensures the customer
                    always has a single point of contact and that it is always
                    taken care of. The lean and simple model results in better
                    performance and customer satisfaction overall.
